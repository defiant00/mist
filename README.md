# Mist

![mist](images/mist1.jpg)

Mist is a one-handed symmetrical and columnar keyboard, with mirrored thumb keys providing 17 usable keys for either hand. It is ideal for anyone needing to type with one hand, or those wanting a staggered one-handed macro pad that can be used with either hand.

The name comes from its primary design goals: **MI**rrored, **ST**aggered.

Mist exists because accessibility should be more accessible. Commercial one-handed keyboards can be prohibitively expensive, and there are few open source keyboards designed specifically for one-handed use. Through this and the [purple firmware/layout project](https://github.com/defiant00/purple) we hope to provide another option.
